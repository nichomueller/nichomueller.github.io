## Experience

After completing my Masters in Applied Mathematics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in 2021, I was awarded a PhD fellowship at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), in Australia. The main focus of the program is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the solution of parameterized partial differential equations using reduced order models. My research mainly revolves around space-time reduction algorithms for computational fluid-dynamics problems, low-rank approximation theory for general tensors, finite element solvers on unfitted meshes, and high performance computing tools. Here, I have also developed other invaluable skills for a researcher, such as the development and maintenance of open source software, as well as the ability to collaborate in a diverse team of researchers—meanwhile strengthening my communication and interpersonal skills.

### Previous positions

- September, 2020 -- February, 2021: *Intern* at [CSEM](https://www.csem.ch/en/), Neuch$\hat{a}$tel, Switzerland.

    Worked as an intern at an R&D company on the development of a topology optimization solver for the generation of novel compliant mechanisms tailored to aerospace applications. The internship was highly research-oriented, involving an extensive literature review in the areas of topology optimization and solid mechanics, along with both theoretical and practical validation of the numerical results. Here, I also gained valuable experience using advanced software tools for stress analysis of mechanical components with Comsol Multiphysics.

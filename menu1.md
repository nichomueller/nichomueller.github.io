## Experience

After completing my Masters in Applied Mathematics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in 2021, I was awarded a PhD fellowship at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), in Australia. The main focus of the program is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the solution of parameterized partial differential equations using reduced order models. My research mainly revolves around space-time reduction algorithms for computational fluid-dynamics problems, low-rank approximation theory for general tensors, finite element solvers on unfitted meshes, and high performance computing tools. Here, I also developed other invaluable skills for a researcher, such as the development and maintenance of open source software, and the ability to collaborate in a diverse team of researchers, developing in the meanwhile strong communication and interpersonal skills.   

### Previous positions

- September, 2020 -- February, 2021: *Intern* at [CSEM](https://www.csem.ch/en/), Neuch$\hat{a}$tel, Switzerland.

    Worked as an intern at an R&D company on the development of a topology optimization solver for the generation of new compliant mechanisms, suited for aerospace applications. The internship was very research-oriented, as it required extensive literature review in the fields of topology optimization and solid mechanics, and a theoretical and practical validation of the numerical results obtained. Programming language(s): Matlab, Comsol Multiphysics, Gmsh.

## Grants, Honors and Awards

1. PhD. fellowship awarded annually by Monash University, 2022 - 2025.

## Research Products with Intellectual Property

Author of [GridapROMs.jl](https://github.com/gridap/GridapROMs.jl), a package for the solution of parameterized partial differential equations with reduced order models, written in the Julia programming language. The package combines algorithmic efficiency with an easy, highly interpretable, user-friendly API. A variety of applications can be solved with the framework provided by the library, including: linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady and transient equations. 

## Programming skills

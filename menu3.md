I am the main author of [Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl), a free and open source reduced order model package exclusively written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Its purpose is the fast solution to parameterized partial differential equations with a variety of cutting-edge strategies in the reduced order model literature. The code features various compression strategies of full-order FE manifolds for the computation of reduced approximation subspaces, including: proper orthogonal decomposition, Tucker decomposition, tensor-train decomposition, discrete interpolation methods, and local subspace strategies. The library supports the solution to a variety of applications, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady and transient equations. The code is characterized by a user-friendly, high-level API which never departs from Julia (i.e., no knowledge of C/C++ or fortran required at any point of the workflow), and is easily extendible by the user.

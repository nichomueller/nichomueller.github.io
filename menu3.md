I am the main author of GridapROMs.jl, a free and open-source reduced order modeling package written entirely in Julia. Its goal is to enable the efficient solution of parameterized partial differential equations using a range of state-of-the-art techniques from the reduced order modeling literature. The library includes multiple strategies for compressing full-order finite element manifolds to construct reduced approximation spaces, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, Tucker decomposition, tensor-train decomposition, discrete interpolation methods, and local subspace techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of applications, including linear and nonlinear problems, single- and multi-field systems, as well as steady and transient equations. The package offers a user-friendly, high-level API that is highly interpretable and is easily extensible by users.

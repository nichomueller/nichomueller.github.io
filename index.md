# Overview

My field of expertise is in **high performance computational mathematics**, under the umbrella of the broader, multi-disciplinary field of {{cse_extended}}, a.k.a. {{sc_extended}}. My research aims, experience, and contributions so far are in the advancement of the state-of-the-art solution strategies for three  main challenges {{cse}} as a discipline has to address, which are key for its success and wide applicability.

\challenge{The numerical and computational challenge}{The ever-increasing demand for accuracy (e.g., the need for increasingly complex and flexible geometry representations, the efficient resolution of multiple time and space scales, or the discrete conservation of continuum balances) in real-world application problems, and the widespread adoption of explicit hardware parallelism (e.g., multi-core CPUs and many-core accelerators) as the  approach to sustain an exponential increase in computational power (as Moore's law dictated), calls for breakthrough inventions in advanced discretization methods (e.g., embedded methods on general polytopal meshes) and scalable solution methods (e.g.,  hybrid multiscale  domain decomposition solvers). 

> To this end, I have specialized in the design of advanced, application-tailored, {{fe_extended}} discretizations and fast and scalable solution methods for the numerical approximation of {{pdes}}, and their parallel message-passing implementation for the efficient exploitation of current petascale distributed memory supercomputers.}

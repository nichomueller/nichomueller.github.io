abstract = {This work proposes novel techniques for the efficient numerical simulation of parameterized, unsteady partial differential equations. Projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) such as the reduced basis method employ a (Petrov-)Galerkin projection onto a linear low-dimensional subspace. In unsteady applications, space–time reduced basis (ST-RB) methods have been developed to achieve a dimension reduction both in space and time, eliminating the computational burden of time marching schemes. However, nonaffine parameterizations dilute any computational speedup achievable by traditional ROMs. Computational efficiency can be recovered by linearizing the nonaffine operators via hyper-reduction, such as the empirical interpolation method in matrix form. In this work, we implement new hyper-reduction techniques explicitly tailored to deal with unsteady problems and embed them in a ST-RB framework. For each of the proposed methods, we develop a posteriori error bounds. We run numerical tests to compare the performance of the proposed ROMs against high-fidelity simulations, in which we combine the finite element method for space discretization on 3D geometries and the Backward Euler time integrator. In particular, we consider a heat equation and an unsteady Stokes equation. The numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency our methods retain with respect to the high-fidelity simulations.}

However, these techniques are prone to severe ill conditioning problems that obstruct the efficient use of iterative Krylov methods and, in consequence, hindersthe practical usage of unfitted methods for realistic large scale applications. In this work, we present a technique that addresses such conditioning problems by constructing enhanced finite element spaces based on a cell aggregation technique. The presented method, called aggregated unfitted finite element method, is easy to implement, and can be used, in contrast to previous works, in Galerkin approximations of coercive problems with conforming Lagrangian finite element spaces. The mathematical analysis of the method states that the condition number of the resulting linear system matrix scales as in standard finite elements for body-fitted meshes, without being affected by small cut cells, and that the method leads to the optimal finite element convergence order. These theoretical results are confirmed with 2D and 3D numerical experiments.}

The goal is to construct efficient projection-based ROMs, which rely on techniques such as the reduced basis method and discrete empirical interpolation. The presence of geometrical parameters in unfitted domain discretizations entails challenges for the application of standard ROMs. Therefore, in this work we propose a methodology based on (i) extension of snapshots on the background mesh and (ii) localization strategies to decrease the number of reduced basis functions. The method we obtain is computationally efficient and accurate, while it is agnostic with respect to the underlying discretization choice. We test the applicability of the proposed framework with numerical experiments on two model problems, namely the Poisson and linear elasticity problems. In particular, we study several benchmarks formulated on two-dimensional, trimmed domains discretized with splines and we observe a significant reduction of the online computational cost compared to standard ROMs for the same level of accuracy. Moreover, we show the applicability of our methodology to a three-dimensional geometry of a linear elastic problem.}

abstract = {A tensor-based method is proposed for the solution of partial differential equations defined on uncertain parameterized domains. It provides an accurate solution which is explicit with respect to parameters defining the shape of the domain, thus allowing efficient a posteriori probabilistic or parametric analyses. In the proposed method, a fictitious domain approach is first adopted for the reformulation of the parametric problem on a fixed domain, yielding a weak formulation in a tensor product space (product of space functions and parametric functions). The paper is limited to the case of Neumann conditions on uncertain parts of the boundary. The Proper Generalized Decomposition method is then introduced for the construction of a tensor product approximation (separated representation) of the solution. It can be seen as an a priori model reduction technique which automatically captures reduced bases of space functions and parametric functions which are optimal for the representation of the solution. This tensor-based method is made computationally tractable by introducing separated representations of variational forms, resulting from separated representations of the parameterized indicator function of the uncertain domain. For this purpose, a method is proposed for the construction of a constrained tensor product approximation which preserves positivity and therefore ensures well-posedness of problems associated with approximate indicator functions. Moreover, a regularization of the geometry is introduced to speed up the convergence of these tensor product approximations.}

abstract = {Embedded boundary methods alleviate many computational challenges, including those associated with meshing complex geometries and solving problems with evolving domains and interfaces. Developing model reduction methods for computational frameworks based on such methods seems however to be challenging. Indeed, most popular model reduction techniques are projection-based, and rely on basis functions obtained from the compression of simulation snapshots. In a traditional interface-fitted computational framework, the computation of such basis functions is straightforward, primarily because the computational domain does not contain in this case a fictitious region. This is not the case however for an embedded computational framework because the computational domain typically contains in this case both real and ghost regions whose definitions complicate the collection and compression of simulation snapshots. The problem is exacerbated when the interface separating both regions evolves in time. This paper addresses this issue by formulating the snapshot compression problem as a weighted low-rank approximation problem where the binary weighting identifies the evolving component of the individual simulation snapshots. The proposed approach is application independent and therefore comprehensive. It is successfully demonstrated for the model reduction of several two-dimensional, vortex-dominated, fluid–structure interaction problems.}

The combination of embedded methods and reduced order models allows us to obtain fast evaluation of parametrized problems, avoiding remeshing as well as the reference domain formulation, often used in the reduced order modeling for boundary fitted finite element formulations. The resulting novel methodology is presented on linear elliptic and Stokes problems, together with several test cases to assess its capability.

First, we use standard B-Splines Finite Elements to solve the Monge–Ampère Equation. An analysis of this approach shows serious limitations when dealing with high variations near the boundary. In order to solve this problem, a new formulation is derived using compatible B-Splines discretization based on a discrete DeRham sequence. A new fast solver is devised in this case using the Fast Diagonalization method. Different tests are provided and show the performance of our new approach.}

abstract = {SUMMARY A new approach for the dimensional reduction via projection of nonlinear computational models based on the concept of local reduced-order bases is presented. It is particularly suited for problems characterized by different physical regimes, parameter variations, or moving features such as discontinuities and fronts. Instead of approximating the solution of interest in a fixed lower-dimensional subspace of global basis vectors, the proposed model order reduction method approximates this solution in a lower-dimensional subspace generated by most appropriate local basis vectors. To this effect, the solution space is partitioned into subregions, and a local reduced-order basis is constructed and assigned to each subregion offline. During the incremental solution online of the reduced problem, a local basis is chosen according to the subregion of the solution space where the current high-dimensional solution lies. This is achievable in real time because the computational complexity of the selection algorithm scales with the dimension of the lower-dimensional solution space. Because it is also applicable to the process of hyper reduction, the proposed method for nonlinear model order reduction is computationally efficient. Its potential for achieving large speedups while maintaining good accuracy is demonstrated for two nonlinear computational fluid and fluid-structure-electric interaction problems.

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to construct more efficient reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations with proper orthogonal decomposition and the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Whereas DEIM projects the nonlinear term onto one global subspace, our localized discrete empirical interpolation method (LDEIM) computes several local subspaces, each tailored to a particular region of characteristic system behavior. Then, depending on the current state of the system, LDEIM selects an appropriate local subspace for the approximation of the nonlinear term. In this way, the dimensions of the local DEIM subspaces, and thus the computational costs, remain low even though the system might exhibit a wide range of behaviors as it passes through different regimes. LDEIM uses machine learning methods in the offline computational phase to discover these regions via clustering. Local DEIM approximations are then computed for each cluster. In the online computational phase, machine-learning-based classification procedures select one of these local subspaces adaptively as the computation proceeds. The classification can be achieved using either the system parameters or a low-dimensional representation of the current state of the system obtained via feature extraction. The LDEIM approach is demonstrated for a reacting flow example of an \$\mathrm H\_2\$-Air flame. In this example, where the system state has a strong nonlinear dependence on the parameters, the LDEIM provides speedups of two orders of magnitude over standard DEIM. }

abstract = {The efficient solution of coupled PDEs/ODEs problems arising in cardiac electrophysiology is of key importance whenever interested to study the electrical behavior of the tissue for several instances of relevant physical and/or geometrical parameters. This poses significant challenges to reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques –such as the reduced basis method –traditionally employed when dealing with the repeated solution of parameter dependent differential equations. Indeed, the nonlinear nature of the problem, the presence of moving fronts in the solution, and the high sensitivity of this latter to parameter variations, make the application of standard ROM techniques very problematic. In this paper we propose a local ROM built through a k-means clustering in the state space of the snapshots for both the solution and the nonlinear term. Several comparisons among alternative local ROMs on a benchmark test case show the effectivity of the proposed approach. Finally, the application to a parametrized problem set on an idealized left-ventricle geometry shows the capability of the proposed ROM to face complex problems.}

A coherent account of the known theory is presented. It includes some stunning results on orders of convergence and guaranteed nonsingularity of interpolation matrices.

We shall enjoy the theoretical discoveries that have been made so far and we will note some interesting conjectures. Earlier reviews of theory are presented by Dyn [12,13].

abstract = {The paper introduces a reduced order model (ROM) for numerical integration of a dynamical system which depends on multiple parameters. The ROM is a projection of the dynamical system on a low dimensional space that is both problem-dependent and parameter-specific. The ROM exploits compressed tensor formats to find a low rank representation for a sample of high-fidelity snapshots of the system state. This tensorial representation provides ROM with an orthogonal basis in a universal space of all snapshots and encodes information about the state variation in parameter domain. During the online phase and for any incoming parameter, this information is used to find a reduced basis that spans a parameter-specific subspace in the universal space. The computational cost of the online phase then depends only on tensor compression ranks, but not on space or time resolution of high-fidelity computations. Moreover, certain compressed tensor formats enable to avoid the adverse effect of parameter space dimension on the online costs (known as the curse of dimension). The analysis of the approach includes an estimate for the representation power of the acquired ROM basis. We illustrate the performance and prediction properties of the ROM with several numerical experiments, where tensorial ROM’s complexity and accuracy is compared to those of conventional POD-ROM.}

abstract = {Abstract A technique for modelling arbitrary discontinuities in finite elements is presented. Both discontinuities in the function and its derivatives are considered. Methods for intersecting and branching discontinuities are given. In all cases, the discontinuous approximation is constructed in terms of a signed distance functions, so level sets can be used to update the position of the discontinuities. A standard displacement Galerkin method is used for developing the discrete equations. Examples of the following applications are given: crack growth, a journal bearing, a non-bonded circular inclusion and a jointed rock mass. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = { Let M be a mesh consisting of \$n^2 \$ squares called elements, formed by subdividing the unit square \$(0,1) \times (0,1)\$ into \$n^2 \$ small squares of side \${1 / h}\$, and having a node at each of the \$(n + 1)^2 \$ grid points. With M we associate the \$N \times N\$ symmetric positive definite system \$Ax = b\$, where \$N = (n + 1)^2 \$, each \$x\_i \$ is associated with a node of M, and \$A\_{ij} \ne 0\$ if and only if \$x\_i \$ and \$x\_j \$ are associated with nodes of the same element. If we solve the equations via the standard symmetric factorization of A, then \$O(n^4 )\$ arithmetic operations are required if the usual row by row (banded) numbering scheme is used, and the storage required is \$O(n^3 )\$. In this paper we present an unusual numbering of the mesh (unknowns) and show that if we avoid operating on zeros, the \$LDL^T \$ factorization of A can be computed using the same standard algorithm in \$O(n^3 )\$ arithmetic operations. Furthermore, the storage required is only \$O(n^2 \log \_2 n)\$. Finally, we prove that all orderings of the mesh must yield an operation count of at least \$O(n^3 )\$, provided we use the standard factorization algorithm. }

The same goes for the abstract part of variational approximations. The difference lies in the description of the finite dimensional approximation spaces. The FEM in any dimension of space is based on the same principle as in one dimension, that is to say, we consider spaces of piecewise polynomials of low degree, with lots of pieces for accuracy. Now things are right away quite different, and actually considerably more complicated, since polynomials have several variables, and open sets are much more varied than in dimension one. For simplicity, we limit ourselves to the two-dimensional case.",

abstract = {Reduced-basis methods (RB methods or RBMs) form one of the most promising techniques to deliver numerical solutions of parametrized PDEs in real-time with reasonable accuracy. For incompressible flow problems, RBMs based on LBB stable velocity–pressure spaces do not generally inherit the stability of the underlying high-fidelity model and, instead, additional stabilization techniques must be introduced. One way of bypassing the loss of LBB stability in the RBM is to inflate the velocity space with supremizer modes. This however deteriorates the performance of the RBM in the performance-critical online stage, as additional DOFs must be introduced to retain stability, while these DOFs do not effectively contribute to accuracy of the RB approximation. In this work we consider a velocity-only RB approximation, exploiting a solenoidal velocity basis. The solenoidal reduced basis emerges directly from the high-fidelity velocity solutions in the offline stage. By means of Piola transforms, the solenoidality of the velocity space is retained under geometric transformations, making the proposed RB method suitable also for the investigation of geometric parameters. To ensure exact solenoidality of the high-fidelity velocity solutions that constitute the RB, we consider approximations based on divergence-conforming compatible B-splines. We show that the velocity-only RB method leads to a significant improvement in computational efficiency in the online stage, and that the pressure solution can be recovered a posteriori at negligible extra cost. We illustrate the solenoidal RB approach by modeling steady two-dimensional Navier–Stokes flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at various angles of attack.}

abstract = {Abstract. In this work, we analyze space-time reduced basis methods for the efficient numerical simulation of hæmodynamics in arteries. The classical formulation of the reduced basis (RB) method features dimensionality reduction in space, while finite difference schemes are employed for the time integration of the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE). Space-time reduced basis (ST–RB) methods extend the dimensionality reduction paradigm to the temporal dimension, projecting the full-order problem onto a low-dimensional spatio-temporal subspace. Our goal is to investigate the application of ST–RB methods to the unsteady incompressible Stokes equations, with a particular focus on stability. High-fidelity simulations are performed using the finite element (FE) method and BDF2 as a time marching scheme. We consider two different ST–RB methods. In the first one—called ST–GRB—space-time model order reduction is achieved by means of a Galerkin projection; a spatio-temporal velocity basis enrichment procedure is introduced to guarantee stability. The second method—called ST–PGRB—is characterized by a Petrov–Galerkin projection, stemming from a suitable minimization of the FOM residual, that allows us to automatically attain stability. The classical RB method—denoted as SRB–TFO—serves as a baseline for the theoretical development. Numerical tests have been conducted on an idealized symmetric bifurcation geometry and on the patient-specific one of a femoropopliteal bypass. The results show that both ST–RB methods provide accurate approximations of the high-fidelity solutions, while considerably reducing the computational cost. In particular, the ST–PGRB method exhibits the best performance, as it features a better computational efficiency while retaining accuracies in accordance with theoretical expectations. }

abstract = {The (Isogeometric) Finite Cell Method–in which a domain is immersed in a structured background mesh–suffers from conditioning problems when cells with small volume fractions occur. In this contribution, we establish a rigorous scaling relation between the condition number of (I)FCM system matrices and the smallest cell volume fraction. Ill-conditioning stems either from basis functions being small on cells with small volume fractions, or from basis functions being nearly linearly dependent on such cells. Based on these two sources of ill-conditioning, an algebraic preconditioning technique is developed, which is referred to as Symmetric Incomplete Permuted Inverse Cholesky (SIPIC). A detailed numerical investigation of the effectivity of the SIPIC preconditioner in improving (I)FCM condition numbers and in improving the convergence speed and accuracy of iterative solvers is presented for the Poisson problem and for two- and three-dimensional problems in linear elasticity, in which Nitche’s method is applied in either the normal or tangential direction. The accuracy of the preconditioned iterative solver enables mesh convergence studies of the finite cell method.}

abstract = {Unfitted finite element methods, e.g., extended finite element techniques or the so-called finite cell method, have a great potential for large scale simulations, since they avoid the generation of body-fitted meshes and the use of graph partitioning techniques, two main bottlenecks for problems with non-trivial geometries. However, the linear systems that arise from these discretizations can be much more ill-conditioned, due to the so-called small cut cell problem. The state-of-the-art approach is to rely on sparse direct methods, which have quadratic complexity and are thus not well suited for large scale simulations. In order to solve this situation, in this work we investigate the use of domain decomposition preconditioners (balancing domain decomposition by constraints) for unfitted methods. We observe that a straightforward application of these preconditioners to the unfitted case has a very poor behavior. As a result, we propose a customization of the classical BDDC methods based on the stiffness weighting operator and an improved definition of the coarse degrees of freedom in the definition of the preconditioner. These changes lead to a robust and algorithmically scalable solver able to deal with unfitted grids. A complete set of complex 3D numerical experiments shows the good performance of the proposed preconditioners.}
